      <h2>What I'm working on</h2>
      <p class="about-text">Through my coursework I have honed my technical expertise and problem-solving abilities. My
        hands-on projects include writing drivers for a BNO055, coding a linear regression model to predict housing
        market trends, and designing interactive educational games using JavaScript.</p>
      <p class="about-text">Beyond the classroom, I’ve gained practical experience working with student organizations,
        where I collaborated closely with peers. Recently, I've been working with the UMASS CubeSat Team to research and
        create a BMS and Power Distribution System, as well as researching PCIe to USB data transmission.</p>
      <p class="about-text">I enjoy exploring new advancements in technology, experimenting with innovative ideas, and
        learning about emerging trends in computer engineering. I am excited to connect with like-minded professionals
        and contribute to impactful projects that push the boundaries of innovation.</p>
