      <p class="about-text">
        I am a Computer Engineering student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst with a focus on
        embedded systems, firmware development, and hardware–software integration. I enjoy building robust end-to-end
        solutions, from writing low-level drivers to designing custom PCBs and 3D printed enclosures.
      </p>

      <p class="about-text">
        Through my personal projects, I have honed my technical expertise and problem-solving abilities. These include
        developing firmware and designing a custom PCB for a DIY camera using a Teensy 4.1, ArduCam Mega, and an LED
        display, writing
        drivers for the BNO055 IMU on a Raspberry Pi Pico, and creating a high-performance terminal text editor in C. I
        have also built a linear regression model to predict house prices and explored real-time visual processing in
        C++.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        Beyond the classroom, I’ve gained practical experience through student engineering organizations, collaborating
        with peers to deliver reliable results. Recently, I have been working with my design group on the UMass CubeSat
        Team to develop a custom battery management system (BMS) and power distribution unit (PDU). This work has
        included writing a research paper outlining a comprehensive radiation protection plan for the power system in a
        three year sun synchronous orbit and creating a prototype schematic for the PDU.

      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        I enjoy exploring new advancements in technology, experimenting with innovative ideas, and learning about
        emerging trends in computer engineering. I’m interested in internship and project opportunities in embedded
        systems, low-level software, and hardware design where I can continue developing my skills and building
        reliable, real-world systems.
